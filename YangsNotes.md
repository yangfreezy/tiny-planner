# NOTES

# User experience additions

- Wanted there to be a product view page for each recipe, to keep the main search page and weekly meal plan page clean and relatively minimalist (users can still go and see all related detail on the product view page)
- Added saved recipes separate from weekly meal plan, in case hypothetical users wanted to save them for later
- Added a way to add directly to the meal plan once a recipe had been saved (kind of massive UI, would love to simplify this later on, but kept it that way for the sake of the coding challenge shim)
- Added a clear meal plan option

# Language:

- JavaScript (crunched on time for TypeScript, but definitely willing to pick up)
  PS I've heard TypeScript and Flow is the way to go with React, so looking to learn those two things here shortly.

# Architecture:

- A permutation of Atomic Design - Brad Frost (swapping templates for pages)

# CSS:

- Styled Components + Reusable Layouts

# localStorage:

- Storing saved recipes
- Storing weekly meal plan

# API:

- Only meal type and diet were free filters, dish type and cuisine type are paid so that data was unfortunately unavailable for my API key.

# Improvements for next time:

I'd have loved more time with this, it was a really fun coding challenge to work on and I felt like it was just complex enough to treat as a real app. I think as a result, I may have gotten a bit carried away with UI, styling, etc, and had to make some trade offs (testing, typescript, commenting) as a result. But to get what what I wanted to get done within the time frame given, I did what I could with architecture, ui design, reusability.

There could definitely be more abstractions made (WeeklyMealPlanList in particular), thorough testing, improvements in user experience all around, etc., but did my best to make the experience somewhat enjoyable for the user while meeting all the application requirements.

Thank you Mustafa for giving me the opportunity to go for this in a language I'm more comfortable in, as well as the bit of extra time. There's definitely tons of improvements that could be made to this still off the top of my head, and also I'm sure a lot more with review from you, but for the sake of getting this challenge in I'll call it here! It's been rad, Tiny Planner! _sheds single tear_
